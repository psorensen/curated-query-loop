Select specific posts to use in a Query Loop

== Description ==
The WordPress Query Loop Block is a powerful block, enabling authors to curate blog content with fine-grained control over the layout. However, it's often a requirement that site editors want to pick the specific posts that appear in these content grids and lists. This WordPress plugin adds a block variation of the Query Loop which provides a content picker, allowing editors to choose the exact posts they want to display, while still leveraging the power of the layout control which comes with the Query Loop Block.
